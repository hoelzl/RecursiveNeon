# RecursiveNeon

A Role-Playing Game (RPG) using LLM-powered NPCs to create an immersive and
dynamic gaming experience. (At least that's what the LLMs tell me...)

Its main goal, however is to illustrate how LLM-assisted software development
can be used to build (somewhat) complex applications, and to demonstrate

- that this way of working doesn't really work as advertised by some, but
- that it is nevertheless a powerful tool in the developer's toolbox.

## Overview

I generated the initial architecture and some code using Claude Sonnet 4.5's
chat interface.

Then I started a Claude Code project with these chats as inputs and asked it to
actually generate the first application version.
